**NOTE: The Connector is currently in public preview and *may* contain breaking
changes.**

The _AlloyDB Java Connector_ is a Java library for connecting securely to your
AlloyDB instances. Using a Connector provides the following benefits:

* **IAM Authorization:** The Connector uses IAM to ensure only principals with valid
  permissions are allowed to connect.
* **Improved Security:** The Connector uses TLS 1.3 encryption and
  identity verification between the client connector and the server-side proxy,
  independent of the database protocol.
* **Convenience:** The Connector removes the requirement to use and distribute SSL
  certificates.

## Usage

This library provides a [socket factory][socket-factory] for use with the
[JDBC Postgres Driver][postgres-driver]. At a high level, you will need to:

1. Configure IAM permissions
1. Add the Connector and Postgres driver as dependencies
1. Configure a connection pool that configures the driver to use the Connector
   as a socket factory

For information on configuring a connection, see the [documentation][jdbc-doc].

### Configuring IAM permissions

The Java Connector uses [Application Default Credentials (ADC)][adc]. For
information on how to configure Application Default Credentials, see the
[documentation][set-adc].

In addition, the associated IAM principal must have the IAM role "Cloud AlloyDB
Client" (i.e., `roles/alloydb.client`). See the [docs on AlloyDB IAM permissions][iam-docs]
for more information.

## Support policy

### Major version lifecycle

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), and uses the
following lifecycle regarding support for a major version:

**Active** - Active versions get all new features and security fixes (that
would not otherwise introduce a breaking change). New major versions are
guaranteed to be "active" for a minimum of 1 year.

**Deprecated** - Deprecated versions continue to receive security and critical
bug fixes, but do not receive new features. Deprecated versions will be
supported for 1 year.

**Unsupported** - Any major version that has been deprecated for >=1 year is
considered unsupported.

### Supported JDK versions

We test and support at minimum, any publicly supported LTS JDK version.
Changes in supported versions will be considered a minor change, and will be
listed in the release notes.

### Release cadence

This project aims for a minimum monthly release cadence. If no new
features or fixes have been added, a new PATCH version with the latest
dependencies is released.
